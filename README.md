# Legal AI Artifacts & Prompt Engineering Portfolio

> Practical AI tools for legal reasoning, decision-making, and cognitive clarity

## Overview

This repository documents my work in **AI-augmented legal workflows** and **hallucination-resistant system design** — combining law, psychology, and prompt engineering to build tools that augment (not replace) human judgment.

## Featured Artifacts

### 1. Patent Drafting & Invention Disclosure Analyzer
**Purpose:** Translate technical descriptions into patent-ready components with claim-oriented reasoning  
**Tech:** Claude API, structured prompting, legal domain constraints  
**Live Demo:** [claude.ai/public/artifacts/4901f625-69d9-4608-9676-f3db1e529fc2](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/4901f625-69d9-4608-9676-f3db1e529fc2)

**Key Features:**
- Problem-solution mapping aligned with patentability standards
- Hallucination-resistant drafting via constrained output structure
- Source-anchored legal reasoning

### 2. Council of Prominent Figures (Multi-Persona Reasoning)
**Purpose:** Structured deliberation system with explicit disagreement handling  
**Tech:** Multi-agent prompting, adversarial reasoning, synthesis constraints  
**Live Demo:** [claude.ai/public/artifacts/b5858ebd-e574-4b7e-a632-4dedc0c0c6d9](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b5858ebd-e574-4b7e-a632-4dedc0c0c6d9)

**Key Features:**
- Role-bounded reasoning (law, psychology, strategy, ethics, tech)
- Bias exposure through forced disagreement
- Second-order thinking under uncertainty

---

### 3. Cognitive Distortion Analyzer
**Purpose:** Detect cognitive distortions in free-form thought and generate CBT-aligned reframes  
**Tech:** Structured classification, non-clinical guardrails  
**Live Demo:** [claude.ai/public/artifacts/17c3e82c-ba9a-460b-9d11-bdaca2c05b37](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/17c3e82c-ba9a-460b-9d11-bdaca2c05b37)

**Key Features:**
- Psychology × AI alignment
- Output consistency across diverse inputs
- Actionable next steps without clinical overreach

---

## Technical Approach

**Prompt Engineering Principles:**
- Domain-specific constraints to reduce hallucination
- Explicit uncertainty handling (speculation marked, assumptions tested)
- Source-anchored outputs (citations, jurisdictional relevance)
- Human-in-the-loop design (tools assist, humans decide)

**Core Competencies:**
- Legal reasoning & statutory interpretation
- Cognitive systems design
- AI quality control & fact-checking
- Structured decision frameworks
